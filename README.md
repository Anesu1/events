## The Events App

This app is using localstorage so there is no backend, the first page is the login page, you can put any details to login and then you can view the dashboard which has the events, you can add aa new event, edit an event and delete and event, you can also view different events on the calendar page. If you refresh by mistake don't you worry your data is being saved in the localstorage so you won't lose anything. Everthing is removed when you logout.
